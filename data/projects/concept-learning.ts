  description: '(1) Ideology is best understood as a cultural technē gone wrong. (2) Cultural technēs are sets of social meanings. (3) The brain constructs situated conceptualizations to predictively categorize inputs, prepare action-plans and anticipate their external and internal consequences based on past experiences in the service of maintaining allostasis. (4) Concepts are carriers of culture and culture is embrained in the form of conceptual knowledge. (5) Social meanings can be conceptualized as culturally supplied concepts. (6) If dismantling ideologies can be understood as changing ideological technēs it might be partially framed as a matter of changing concepts. – … So how do concepts change as concept learning takes place? The following analyzes and substantiates these premises and explores their implications with respect to concept learning under conditions of ideology. I will introduce and draw on Sally Haslanger’s account of ideology and Lisa Feldman Barrett’s work on how a predictive brain constructs mental phenomena, before pointing out what I consider to be interesting conceptual intersections, and their implications with respect to the subject of interest: dismantling ideologies.',
