  description: 'In ‹Transformative Experience› L. A. Paul identifies a challenge transformative choices, that is choices about undergoing transformative experiences, pose for standard conceptions of normative decision theory. If one faces a choice that involves a transformative experience as a downstream effect of that choice, the agent cannot assign value to the outcomes of at least one of the alternatives, thus not choose rationally between them. In ‹Transformative Choices› and ‹Hard Choices› Ruth Chang crafts her own account of transformative choices and introduces the concept of will based reasons through commitment as a path of rational action if an agents reasons run out during a choice. The following will sketch out both accounts, introduce the main concepts employed and highlight core differences. This will build towards the question of whether Ruth Changs account of will based reasons through commitment might provide a possible path forward for the challenge to rational choice posed by L. A. Paul.',
