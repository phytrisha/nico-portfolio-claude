  description: 'DEI measures are under attack. A growing fraction of the political right sees them as ineffective and unjustified gimmicks or harmful projects that threaten the narrative of a presumed meritocratic order. Of course the motivations behind such anti DEI campaigns are complex and often deeply rooted in sexism, racism, and classism. Any argument that aims to support the benefits of diversity will face challenges of ideology and deeply anchored prejudice, often deflected and masked as more shallow concerns for meritocracy. Despite these limitations putting forward compelling arguments for the epistemic benefits of diversity wherever feasible may serve as a meaningful contribution to the broader endeavour of exposing such narratives as lacking both conceptual coherence and empirical support. This essay develops an argument in favor of the epistemic benefits of diversity and shows how the interactionist theory of reason, ITR, developed by Dan Sperber and Hugo Mercier lends conceptual support to the argument that practices of transformative criticism, which promote objectivity, benefit from a diverse epistemic communities – a view developed by Helen Longinos critical contextual empiricism, CCE.',
